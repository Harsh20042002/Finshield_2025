# Finshield – Alternative Data-Driven Credit Risk Prototype  

## 📌 Overview  
**Finshield** is a prototype credit risk management framework designed to improve financial inclusion by leveraging both **conventional** and **alternative data sources**.  
It predicts:  
- **Credit Score** (continuous)  
- **Probability of Not Default (PD)**  

Unlike traditional credit scoring systems that rely heavily on credit history, Finshield integrates **behavioral, transactional, and digital footprint data** to assess thin-file and underbanked borrowers, enabling **fairer, faster, and more inclusive lending decisions**.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Multi-Output Regression**: Simultaneous prediction of credit score & default probability.  
- **Alternative Data Usage**: Mobile usage, utility bill payments, digital wallet transactions, e-commerce behavior, and more.  
- **Defaulter Search & Tracking**: Early-warning system for monitoring borrower risk.  
- **Modeling Approaches**: Linear Regression (baseline), Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Deep Learning (MLP, CNN, LSTM).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, R², residual analysis, and cross-validation.  

---

## 📊 Business Impact  
- Expand lending opportunities for **MSMEs and underbanked populations**.  
- Reduce **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)** with improved risk prediction.  
- Enable **faster, automated, and transparent** credit decisions.  
- Support **fairer loan terms** for creditworthy but thin-file borrowers.  
- Build a **sustainable ecosystem** for lenders and borrowers.

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Acquisition** – Conventional (credit history, bank statements) + Alternative (mobile usage, utility bills, social presence).  
2. **EDA & Feature Engineering** – Scaling, encoding, correlation checks, dimensionality reduction.  
3. **Model Development** – Multi-output regression using tree-based ML and neural networks.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Comprehensive testing with cross-validation and performance metrics.  
5. **Deployment Scope** – Future-ready for APIs, explainability (SHAP/LIME), and MLOps integration.

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- **Best Performer:** LightGBM – highest accuracy and efficiency.  
- **MLP Neural Network:** Competitive with potential for time-series & behavioral extensions.  
- **CNN & LSTM:** Underperformed for static tabular data but promising for sequential/temporal datasets.  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Integration of **open banking APIs** and **real-time financial data**.  
- Advanced **explainability & bias mitigation** for regulatory compliance.  
- **Hybrid models** (GBM + Deep Learning) and stacked ensembles.  
- Deployment of **real-time scoring APIs** and **drift detection** systems.
